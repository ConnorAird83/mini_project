  "description": "1. You'll find a few files for the mini-project in this zip:     1. academy.js - the JavaScript file containing some function stubs. This is what you should add to in order to get the game working.     2. index.html - the webpage that Noughts & Crosses will render on. Open this in your browser to see your code working. You shouldn't need to edit this file.     3. main.css - some basic styling for the game, you shouldn't need to make changes here.     4. connectors.js - logic to join up academy.js to the webpage, you shouldn't need to make changes here either. 2. Open \"index.html\" in your browser. Press F12 (or your browsers equivalent) to open the developer tools, and navigate to the console. 3. Clicking on the grid and reset button should print messages in the console that line up with the functions in \"academy.js\" 4. Fill out the functions in \"academy.js\" to make the game work! Check the console in your browser for error messages as you go. Make small changes, use log messages and refresh the browser often to check your code. 5. If you get stuck, ask for help!",
